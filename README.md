# Detection-of-Plant-Leaf-Diseases
This repository contains the project for detecting plant leaf diseases using non-imaging data. The project leverages various data points other than images, such as environmental factors, plant physiological parameters, and other relevant non-visual data to accurately identify and diagnose diseases in plant leaves.

# Project Overview
Plant diseases can significantly impact agricultural productivity, and early detection is crucial for effective management and control. Traditional methods rely heavily on visual inspection, which can be time-consuming and require expert knowledge. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can detect plant leaf diseases using non-imaging data, making the detection process more accessible and efficient.

# Features
Non-Imaging Data Utilization: Uses various non-visual data points such as environmental conditions, soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and plant physiological parameters.
Machine Learning Model: Implements advanced machine learning techniques to analyze the data and predict the presence of diseases.
Scalable and Efficient: Designed to be scalable for different types of plants and diseases, and efficient in terms of computation and resource usage.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes non-imaging data collected from various sources. It consists of features such as:

# Environmental factors (temperature, humidity, etc.)
Soil parameters (moisture, pH, etc.)
Plant physiological data (growth rate, leaf characteristics, etc.)
